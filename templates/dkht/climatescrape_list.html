            <p class="subheader flow-text">In the process of developing this application,
              I realized I had to place a few restrictions on the search to avoid some risk of racking up large server charges.</p>
            <p class="subheader flow-text">For this reason, the largest search radius is set to 40km.
              If you'd like a custom query, either for a larger search area, for hourly climate data,
              or for any other large data manipulation tasks, feel free to <a href="{% url 'dkht:contact-view' %}">contact me</a>,
